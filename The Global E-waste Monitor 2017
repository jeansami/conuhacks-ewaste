The Global E-waste Monitor 2017
	Increasing levels of electronic waste, improper/ unsafe treatment
	Risk for the environment and human health
	Challenges to sustainable development (Sustainable Development Goals - SDGs of UN)
	Why ?
		Digitalization and information society
			2017 : 1/2 of the world's population has access to internet 
					Most of them has access to mobile networks and services
		Replacement Cycles for mobile phones and computers become shorter
		Growth in spendings on electrical and electronical equipment
	
	Better data to track this are needed

	
	"Generation of E-waste Has Grown to 44.7 Million Metric Tonnes Annually 
	â€“ Equivalent to Almost 4,500 Eiffel Towers" in 2016
	"5.8 kg/inhabitant" in 2014
	"6.1 kg/inhabitant" in 2016
	 49.8 million tons in 2018
	"6.8 kg/inhabitant" in 2021 52.2 million metric tonnes

	According to a recent report by the EPA, every day, we are to get rid of over 416,000 mobile devices and 142,000 computers either by recycling or disposing of them in landfills and incinerators

	Another EPA report reveals that by recycling one million cell phones, we can recover more than 20,000 lbs of copper, 20 lbs of palladium, 550 lbs of silver, and 50 lbs of gold

	Compared to disposal in landfills or by incinerators, reusing or recycling computers can create 296 more jobs per year for every 10,000 tons of computer waste processed

	"e-Waste comprises 2% of America's trash in landfills and 70% of overall toxic waste" https://www.americaupcycles.com/e-waste 
	Only 20% of E-waste Generated Is Documented To Be Collected and Recycled

	Asia Generates the Greatest Amounts of E-waste; Africa the Least, Both in Total and Per Inhabitant

	Only 41 Countries Have Official E-waste Statistics
		With the fast growth of the waste and e-waste in particular, we need to address it quickly

	More Countries Adopt E-waste Legislation
		So the need of more data

	Huge Amounts of Raw Materials Are Wasted
